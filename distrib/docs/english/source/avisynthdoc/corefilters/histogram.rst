Histogram
=========
A multipurpose audio/video analysis tool.

Syntax and Parameters
----------------------
::

    Histogram (clip, string "mode", float "factor", int "bits", bool "keepsource", bool "markers",
    string "matrix", 
    string "graticule", bool "targets", bool "axes", bool "iq", bool "iq_lines", bool "circle")

.. describe:: clip

    Source clip; bit depths greater than 8 are supported in Classic, Levels,
    Luma and Colors modes only.

    * Classic, Color, Color2 and Luma modes support all planar YUV(A) formats.
    * Levels mode support RGB24/32/48/64 and all planar RGB(A)/YUV(A) formats.
    * Audiolevels and StereoOverlay modes support all 8-bit YUV(A) formats.
    * Stereo and StereoY8 accept any 8-bit format but always return a 512x512
      YUV420P8 or a Y8 clip respectively. If only an audio clip is given then
      the output clip will have a framerate of 25FPS.
    * Audiolevels and Stereo* modes support all audio samples types.

.. describe:: mode

    Select the ``mode`` to display:

    * :ref:`"Classic" <histogram-classic>` : waveform mode;
    * :ref:`"Levels" <histogram-levels>` : RGB/YUV/Y histogram mode;
    * :ref:`"Color" <histogram-color>` : vectorscope mode;
    * :ref:`"Color2" <histogram-color2>` : vectorscope mode with overlays;
    * :ref:`"Luma" <histogram-luma>` : special viewing mode;
    * :ref:`"Audiolevels" <histogram-audiolevels>` : audio level meter; and
    * :ref:`"Stereo", "StereoOverlay", "StereoY8" <histogram-stereo>` : audio graphs.

    Default: "classic"

.. describe:: factor

    Applies only to Levels mode.
    The ``factor`` option specifies the way how the graphs are displayed,
    exaggerating the vertical scale. It is specified as percentage of the total
    population (that is number of luma or chroma pixels in a frame). For example,
    ``Histogram("Levels", 1.5625)`` will achieve a 1/64th cap. The vertical scale
    is multiplied by 100.0 / ``factor``.

    | Range: 0.0 - 100.0
    | Default: 100.0

.. describe:: bits

    Accepts 8, 9, 10, 11 or 12 as input. Applies only to Classic, Levels and
    Color/Color2 (vectorscope) modes.

    * Classic, Levels: increases the width of the histogram by 2\ :sup:`(bits-8)`
    * Color/Color2: increases width and height of the histogram by 2\ :sup:`(bits-8)`

    For example, ``Histogram(bits=10)`` returns a 1024-pixel wide histogram
    (width is 256 by default).

    Default: 8

.. describe:: keepsource

    If true, add histogram to right side of existing clip; else return the
    histogram portion only. Applies only to Classic, Levels, Color and Color2 modes.

    Default: true

.. describe:: markers

    If true, show calibration marks (see screenshots); else hide them.
    For Levels mode it will also remove the colored background. Applies only to
    Classic and Levels modes.

    Default: true

.. describe:: matrix

    Applies to Color/Color2 mode. Specifies the YUV matrix used to interpret the
    chroma values of the input clip, and determines the correct U/V positions of
    the color bar target boxes and I/Q markers drawn on the vectorscope.

    Accepted values follow the same convention as the ``ConvertToYUV`` family of
    functions, for example: ``"2020"``, ``"709"``, etc..

    If not specified, the matrix is read from the clip's ``_Matrix`` and
    ``_ColorRange`` frame properties. If those are absent, BT.601 is assumed.

    Default: (empty, means auto from frame properties or else BT.601)

.. describe:: graticule

    Applies only to Color and Color2 modes. Controls the visibility of the
    graticule overlay — the valid chroma range boundary square (16–240 in 8-bit,
    scaled for higher bit depths) in Color2 mode, and the danger zone shading in
    Color mode.

    * ``"on"`` (default): Always draw the graticule, regardless of the clip's
      color range. This preserves the behavior of versions prior to 3.7.6.
    * ``"off"``: Never draw the graticule.
    * ``"auto"``: Draw the graticule only for limited-range clips. For full-range
      clips, where the valid chroma area extends to the display edges, the
      graticule is suppressed to avoid clutter.

    Default: ``"on"``


.. describe:: targets

    Applies only to Color and Color2 modes. If true, draw small target boxes on the
    vectorscope at the expected U/V positions of the six 75%-amplitude
    :doc:`ColorBars <colorbars>` colors (Yellow, Cyan, Green, Magenta, Red,
    Blue). The positions are computed from ground-truth linear RGB values
    converted through the active ``matrix``, and limited or full range property
    of the clip; giving accurate targets for any supported matrix and bit depth.

    Default: false

.. describe:: axes

    Applies only to Color and Color2 modes. If true, draw horizontal and vertical crosshair
    lines through the center of the vectorscope, marking the U (Cb) and V (Cr)
    axes.

    Default: false

.. describe:: iq

    Applies only to Color and Color2 modes. If true, draw target boxes for the NTSC −I, and
    +Q (ColorBars) and +I (ColorBarsHD) chroma-phase reference signals. These are 
    defined by the luma-corrected broadcast convention (Option 2 below) and are 
    computed through the active ``matrix``. 

    The −I and +Q signals are traditionally zero-luma, 20 IRE saturation chroma
    axis references from the NTSC subcarrier standard. Three interpretations exist
    in digital studio-swing environments:

    For displaying them on RGB or YUV, "hack" is needed to reach valid RGB/YUV values, 
    for more information see ColorBars documentation.

    Default: false

.. describe:: iq_lines

    Applies only to Color and Color2 modes. If true, draw radial lines on the vectorscope
    passing through the −I/+I and +Q/−Q axis positions. Together with ``axes``,
    this produces the full eight-line graticule (four cardinal lines at 0°/90°/
    180°/270° and four diagonal lines through the I/Q phase references) commonly
    seen on broadcast vectorscopes.

    The diagonal line angles are not derived from the actual computed I/Q U/V
    positions, and use always textbook values of 33°/123°.

    Default: false

.. describe:: circle

    Applies only to Color and Color2 modes. If true (default for color2), draws 
    hue circle with 15° tick marks around the circumference.

    Default: true ("color2"), false ("Color")

.. _histogram-classic:

Classic mode
------------

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-classic.png
   :align: left

This will add a per-line luminance graph (called a `Waveform Monitor`_) on the
right side of the video. The left side of the graph represents the minimum pixel
value (0) and the right side represents the maximum pixel value (for example,
255 for 8-bit). Values outside the valid  :doc:`CCIR-601 <limiter>` range are
shown in a brown/yellow-ish color, and a greenish line represents the midpoint
for limited range (e.g. 126 for 8-bit since the median of [16,235] is 125.5).

|clearfloat|

.. _histogram-levels:

Levels mode
-----------

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-levels-rgb.png
   :align: left

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-levels-yuv.png
   :align: left

This mode will display three `histograms`_ on the right side of the video frame.
This will show the distribution of the R,G,B or Y,U,V components in the current
frame.

The top graph displays the luma (R) or red (Y) distribution of the frame, where
the left side represents the minimum pixel value (0) and the right side
represents the maximum pixel value (for example, 255 for 8-bit). For YUV, the
valid :doc:`CCIR-601 <limiter>` range has been indicated by a slightly different
color. The midpoint is marked with a dotted line (for example, 128 for 8-bit).
The vertical axis shows the number of pixels for a given luma (Y) value. The
middle graph is similar and displays the G or U component, and the bottom graph
displays the B or V component.

|clearfloat|

.. _histogram-color:

Color mode
----------

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-color.png
   :align: left

This mode displays the chroma values (U/V color placement) in a two-dimensional
graph called a `vectorscope`_, appended to the right side of the video frame.
It functions as a histogram at the same time: the whiter a pixel in the
vectorscope, the more pixels of the input clip share that chroma value. The
shaded background denotes the valid :doc:`CCIR-601 <limiter>` range (danger zone
shading can be controlled with the ``graticule`` parameter).

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-color-labeled.png
   :align: left

Labels have been added to the second image for reference, showing the U and V
axes and degrees of hue. Spots show 75% saturated :doc:`ColorBars <colorbars>`
(clockwise from 0°: blue, magenta, red, yellow, green and cyan).

The U component is displayed on the horizontal (X) axis (left = 0, right = 255)
and the V component on the vertical (Y) axis (top = 0, bottom = 255).

A spot's position on the scope corresponds to a chroma value from the input
clip. As hue changes, the spot moves around the center; as saturation changes,
it moves in or out. The center (U=V=128) represents zero saturation — no color.
At U=255, V=128 the hue is zero (blue) at maximum saturation:
saturation = sqrt( (U-128)\ :sup:`2` + (V-128)\ :sup:`2` ) = 127.
Turning hue clockwise 90° gives U=128, V=255 (red, approximately). Decreasing
saturation at constant hue moves the spot toward the center, fading the color
to :doc:`greyscale <greyscale>`.

|clearfloat|

.. _histogram-color2:

Color2 mode
-----------

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-color2.png
   :align: left

This mode displays pixels in a two-dimensional `vectorscope`_ appended to the
right side of the video frame. It can be used to read the `hue`_ and
`saturation`_ of a clip.

The U and V axes are laid out identically to **Color** mode (see above).
The grey square (graticule) denotes the valid limited-range Cb/Cr boundary
(16–240 in 8-bit; see also :doc:`CCIR-601 <limiter>`).

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-color2-labeled.png
   :align: left

As in **Color** mode, labels and :doc:`ColorBars <colorbars>` dots have been
added to the second image for reference.

Unlike **Color** mode, the background is black rather than shaded, the signal
dots are brighter and rendered in color, and a color wheel is drawn around the
circumference of the scope divided into six hues (clockwise from 0°: blue,
magenta, red, yellow, green and cyan) with white tick marks at 15° intervals.

|clearfloat|

.. _histogram-vectorscope-overlays:

Vectorscope overlays: Color and Color2
---------------------------------------

Both **Color** and **Color2** modes share a common set of optional overlays.
The fundamental difference between the two modes is that **Color** operates as
a density histogram plotted over a pre-drawn UV shade background, while
**Color2** plots individual pixels on a black background with a color wheel.

Both modes are matrix-aware: the ``matrix`` parameter (or the clip's ``_Matrix``
and ``_ColorRange`` frame properties) controls how chroma values are interpreted
and where overlay markers are positioned, giving accurate results for BT.601,
BT.709, BT.2020 and other supported matrices at all bit depths.

**Optional overlays:**

**Example usage**::

    # Show ColorBars with full vectorscope overlay (BT.601 auto-detected)
    ColorBars()
    Histogram("color2", targets=true, axes=true, iq=true, iq_lines=true)

    # Override matrix interpretation to BT.709 for an SD clip tagged as 601
    Histogram("color2", matrix="709", targets=true, iq=true)

    # Suppress the graticule only for full-range clips
    Histogram("color2", graticule="auto")

    # Switch on all overlays in Color mode
    Histogram("color", graticule="on", targets=true, axes=true, iq=true, iq_lines=true, circle=true)


|clearfloat|

.. _histogram-luma:

Luma mode
---------

.. figure:: pictures/histogram_modeluma-crop.jpg
   :align: left

This mode will amplify luminance, and display very small luminance
variations. This is good for detecting blocking and noise, and can be helpful
at adjusting filter parameters. In this mode a 1-pixel luminance difference
will show as a 16-pixel luminance pixel, thus seriously enhancing small
flaws.

|clearfloat|

.. _histogram-stereo:

Stereo, StereoY8 and StereoOverlay mode
---------------------------------------

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-stereo.png
   :align: left

This mode shows a stereo graph (known as a `goniometer`_ or phase scope), from
the audio in the clip. This can be used to see the left-right and phase
distribution of the input signal. Each frame will contain only information from
the current frame to the beginning of the next frame. The signal is linearly
upsampled 8x, to provide clearer visuals. Only **StereoOverlay** will overlay
the graph on top of the source clip. **Stereo** and **StereoY8** just return a
512x512 clip of the graph.

|clearfloat|

.. _histogram-audiolevels:

AudioLevels mode
----------------

.. figure:: pictures/histogram-audiolevels.png
   :align: left

Shows the audio levels in `decibels`_ for each channel present. For example, if
the source has six channels of audio, six vertical bars will be shown. The audio
levels are overlaid over the source clip.

The green bars show the *RMS* level and the blue bars show the *max* (peak)
level, both are calculated with the formulas listed below. The color of the bar
changes color to red and yellow whenever that specific channel's peak reaches
0.0dB.

|clearfloat|

**Formulas**

The green bars show the *RMS* (`Root Mean Square`_) level of the audio in each
video frame (let's say *n* samples) using the following formula:

.. math::  RMS = 20 * \log_{10}(1 / 32768 * \sqrt{1/n * \sum_{j=1}^n sample(j)^2})

The blue bars show the *max* (peak) level of the audio in each video frame
using the following formula:

.. math:: max = 20 * \log_{10}(max_{\text{j}}(sample(j))/32768)

The maximum possible level without `clipping`_ is 0 dB by definition. The
minimum level for 16 bit audio is therefore:

.. math:: 20 * \log_{10}(1/32768) = -90.31 dB \qquad (\text{since} \quad 2^{16} / 2 = 32768)
