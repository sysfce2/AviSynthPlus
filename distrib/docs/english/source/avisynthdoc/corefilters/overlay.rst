Overlay
=======

Puts clip ``overlay`` on top of clip ``base`` using different blend ``modes``, and 
with optional ``x``, ``y`` positioning, ``mask`` operation and ``opacity``. 

* In some modes the input clips (``base``, ``overlay`` and ``mask``) are converted 
  to 4:4:4 internally. The output is re-converted to the input colorspace (or to the 
  ``output`` colorspace, if specified). 
  But, if possible, original colorspace is preserved during the processing, such as 
  in "blend", "luma" and "chroma" modes; or RGB in "add" and "subtract". See ``use444``, 
  below.
* Only specific modes like "blend", "luma", "chroma", "add", and "subtract" support 32-bit float input. 
  For these modes, 32-bit float input is natively supported, and the behavior is consistent 
  with other formats, but clamping is not necessarily done.
* "add" and "subtract" modes also support conversionless RGB processing without the internal
  conversion to 4:4:4. This means that for RGB sources, the overlay operation is 
  performed directly in the RGB domain, avoiding unnecessary colorspace conversions.
* In general all clips are treated as full-range values. This means that numbers will 
  not be clipped at TV range; you may use :doc:`Limiter <limiter>` for this task afterwards. 
  If your ``mask`` is TV-range, you should convert it to full-range, or the mask will 
  never be fully opaque. You can use :doc:`Histogram <histogram>` in ``Histogram("levels")`` 
  mode to view the color distributions. If your mask is of limited (TV) range, use
  ``ConvertBits(fulls=false, fulld=true)`` or ``ColorYUV(levels="TV->PC`` to upscale 
  the color levels.
* It is not recommended to do overlays on interlaced material, unless you know what 
  you are doing. 


Syntax and Parameters
---------------------
::

    Overlay (clip, clip overlay, int "x", int "y", clip "mask", float "opacity",
             string "mode", bool "greymask", string "output",
             bool "ignore_conditional", bool "pc_range", bool "use444",
             string "condvarsuffix", string "placement")

.. describe:: clip

    This clip will be the base, and the overlay picture will be placed on top of
    this.

.. describe:: overlay
    
    This is the image that will be placed on top of the base clip. The colorspace
    or image dimensions do not have to match the base clip.

.. describe:: x, y

    These two variables define the placement of the overlay image on the base
    clip in pixels. The variable can be positive or negative.

    Default: 0, 0

.. describe:: mask

    Optional transparency mask for the overlay image. Must be the same size as 
    the overlay clip. Where mask is darker, overlay will be more transparent. 
    
    By default only the greyscale (luma) components are used, but this can be 
    overridden with ``greymask``=``false``. 

    There is no default, but not specifying is equivalent to supplying a fully
    255 (in general ``2^bit_depth - 1``  for 8-16 bit formats or ``1.0`` for
    32 bit float format) clip. Maximum pixel value means a 1.0 mask multiplier,
    that means full opacity.

    Internally each mask pixel is treated as the fraction ``mask_value /
    max_pixel_value`` (255 for 8-bit, up to 65535 for 16-bit, or the value
    itself for 32-bit float). For integer formats the two ends are exact:
    ``mask=0`` reproduces ``base`` untouched, ``mask=max`` reproduces ``overlay``
    exactly, identical to omitting the mask. Note: since ``max_pixel_value`` is
    always odd, no integer value strictly between them is an exact half, so
    e.g. ``mask=127`` or ``128`` (8-bit) are only the closest approximation to
    50%. Use 32-bit float input for exact fractional mask values.

.. describe:: opacity

    This will set how transparent your image will be. The value is from 0.0 to
    1.0, where 0.0 is transparent and 1.0 is fully opaque (if no mask is used).
    When used together with a mask this value is multiplied by the mask value to
    form the **final** opacity.

    Default: 1.0

    Since v3.7.6, ``opacity`` is scaled internally the same way as ``mask``,
    as a fraction of ``max_pixel_value``, instead of the fixed 0..256 range
    used before. This gives it the same fine granularity as ``mask`` at higher
    bit depths (e.g. 65536 steps at 16-bit) rather than a flat 257 steps
    regardless of bit depth. The endpoint exactness and the no-exact-half behavior
    described above for ``mask`` applies to ``opacity`` too, and to their
    combination when both are used together: a fully opaque mask always
    reproduces the ``opacity``-only result.

.. describe:: mode

    Mode defines how your clip should be overlaid on your image.

    Default: "Blend"

.. describe:: greymask

    Specifies whether chroma should be used for chroma transparency. Generally you 
    want to leave this alone, this mode shouldn't be disabled. External filters like
    ``mSharpen`` and ``Masktools`` are able to export proper chroma maps. 

    Default: true

.. describe:: output

    It is possible to make Overlay return another colorspace.
    e.g. "YV24", "YUV420P14" or "RGB64" 

    Default: (input colorspace)

.. describe:: ignore_conditional

    Ignore any given conditional (runtime) variables. 

    See also: conditional variables section :doc:`ColorYUV <coloryuv>`, or 
    :doc:`ConditionalReader <conditionalreader>` or 
    http://avisynth.nl/index.php/ColorYUV.

    Default: false

.. describe:: pc_range

    When set to true, this will make all internal RGB→YUV→RGB conversions assume that 
    YUV sources are full-range instead of the default TV range. It is only recommended
    to change this setting if you know what you are doing. See RGB considerations below.

    Planned on the roadmap: when frame property _ColorRange is supported in Avisynth, Overlay 
    will be able to automatically detect the range of the input clips, and adjust accordingly.
    Only when pc_range is intentionally given, would it override the automatic detection.
    But this is not yet implemented.

    Default: false

.. describe:: use444

    If set to false, Overlay uses conversionless mode where possible instead of going
    through YUV 4:4:4. However, for ``Luma`` and ``Chroma`` modes, RGB must be converted
    to YUV 4:4:4.

    Default: (adaptive)

    * false when mode="blend" and format is RGB
    * false when mode="blend", "luma" or "chroma" and format is YUV420, YUV422, YUV411,
      YUV440 or YUV410 (YV12/YV16/YV411/etc., any bit depth). Original format is kept
      throughout the whole process, no 4:4:4 conversion occurs.
    * false when mode="add" or mode="subtract" and format is RGB
    * true for all other cases (input is converted internally to 4:4:4) — this always
      includes "multiply", and "add"/"subtract" on non-RGB YUV, regardless of format.

    When ``use444=false`` (conversionless mode) is in effect for a subsampled YUV format
    (4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:1:1, 4:4:0 or 4:1:0) and ``greymask=true`` (default), the
    luma-resolution mask is downsampled to chroma resolution on the fly. The
    ``placement`` parameter controls the filter weights used for this downsampling.
    Overlay and mask clips that don't already match the base clip's exact format are
    converted to match via the corresponding ``ConvertToYUV420``/``ConvertToYUV422``/
    ``ConvertToYUV411``/``ConvertToYUV440``/``ConvertToYUV410`` call, which respects
    chroma placement via its own ``ChromaInPlacement``/``ChromaOutPlacement`` defaults.
    (Prior to 3.7.6, 4:2:0/4:2:2 formats used an internal 4:4:4 proxy bridge with a
    fixed, left-aligned siting independent of ``placement``; all subsampled formats now
    go through the same placement-aware conversion.)

    Note that ``placement`` is a single value for the whole filter call. For this
    conversionless mode it is only ever used to steer the mask's chroma downsampling;
    it is not verified against the base or overlay clip's own actual chroma siting, nor
    are the base and overlay clips checked against each other. If they were authored
    with genuinely different chroma siting, this silently proceeds as if they matched.
    Anyway, as of 3.7.6, this is not checked at all.

.. describe:: condvarsuffix

    Allows multiple filter instances to use differently named conditional parameters.
    Prevents collision and overwrite of variables which are used by different Overlay 
    instances.

    See also: conditional variables section :doc:`ColorYUV <coloryuv>`, or 
    :doc:`ConditionalReader <conditionalreader>`, or :doc:`RGBAdjust <adjust>`.
    
    How does it work: when reading the global variables, the ``condvarsuffix`` parameter is 
    appended to the variable name. E.g. variable name "myvar_a" will be read instead of 
    "myvar" when ``condvarsuffix = "_a"`` is provided.
    
    Useful for ``ColorYUV``, ``RGBAdjust``, ``Overlay`` when the conditional variables
    are enabled (or here, in Overlay, is not disabled).

    In the matching ConditionalReader one have to use the modified name as well:

    ::

        ConditionalReader("overlay_a_offset.txt", "OL_opacity_offset", false, CondVarSuffix = "_a")
        # "_a" is added here by parameter

    or specify the suffixed name directly:

    ::

        ConditionalReader("overlay_a_offset.txt", "OL_opacity_offset_a", false)
        # "_a" is added here manually

    Default: ""

.. describe:: placement

    Specifies the chroma sample placement for subsampled YUV formats (4:2:0, 4:2:2,
    4:1:1, 4:4:0, or 4:1:0). Accepted values (case-insensitive): ``"mpeg2"``,
    ``"mpeg1"``, and ``"top_left"``.

    This single value drives two different things, depending on whether the
    internal working format ends up 4:4:4 or stays subsampled (see ``use444``):

    * **Conversionless/native mode** (``use444=false``, ``greymask=true`` (default),
      and the internal working format is subsampled 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:1:1/4:4:0/4:1:0):
      the luma-resolution mask is filtered down to chroma resolution once per row
      (shared for U and V), and the filter weights depend on the declared chroma
      placement of the source material.
    * **Forced 4:4:4 round trip** (``use444=true``, i.e. "multiply", "add"/"subtract"
      on non-RGB YUV, and RGB→4:4:4 conversions for "luma"/"chroma"): whenever the
      base clip, overlay clip, or mask don't already match the internal 4:4:4 working
      format, ``placement`` is passed as ``ChromaInPlacement`` to the
      ``ConvertToYUV444`` call that brings them in, and as ``ChromaOutPlacement`` to
      the final ``ConvertToYUV420``/``ConvertToYUV422``/``ConvertToYUV411``/
      ``ConvertToYUV440``/``ConvertToYUV410`` call that reconstructs the output
      pixel format — so the same siting is assumed on the way in and reproduced on the
      way out, keeping a 4:2:0→4:4:4→4:2:0 (etc.) round trip free of any chroma shift.
      ``ConvertToYUV4xx``'s own ``ChromaInPlacement``/``ChromaOutPlacement``
      parser is not equally permissive for all three raw names on every subsampled
      format, though: 4:1:1 and 4:1:0 both accept ``"mpeg2"``, ``"mpeg1"`` and
      ``"top_left"`` directly (empirically verified against all six combinations —
      3 names × In/Out — for each). 4:4:0 is the odd one out: it has no horizontal
      subsampling to site, and its parser only recognizes ``"center"``/``"top"`` —
      passing ``"mpeg2"`` or ``"top_left"`` straight through throws
      ``"4:4:0 has no standard chroma siting..."``. Overlay maps around this rather
      than surfacing it: for any call touching a 4:4:0 clip, ``"mpeg1"`` is
      translated to ``"center"`` and ``"mpeg2"``/``"top_left"`` are both translated
      to ``"top"`` before the ``ConvertToYUV444``/``ConvertToYUV440`` Invoke.

    **4:2:0 and 4:2:2** have real, named industry conventions, so all three values
    behave distinctly there. **4:1:1, 4:4:0, and 4:1:0** have no standard siting
    convention, so only two distinct behaviors exist per format: ``"mpeg2"`` and
    ``"top_left"`` always collapse to the same point-sample behavior, and only
    ``"mpeg1"`` (the one placement that actually asks for a centered box average)
    is distinct — the same grouping for all three formats. ``"mpeg2"`` (H
    co-sited, V centered) reduces to ``"top_left"``'s point-sample behavior on a
    format that subsamples horizontally (4:1:1, 4:1:0); on 4:4:0, which subsamples
    only vertically, ``"mpeg2"``'s H-component is moot to begin with, so with no H
    axis to be co-sited on it collapses to ``"top_left"`` there too rather than to
    ``"mpeg1"``:

    .. list-table:: Effective chroma siting by format and ``placement`` value
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 10 30 30 30

       * - Format
         - ``"mpeg2"``
         - ``"mpeg1"``
         - ``"top_left"``
       * - 4:2:0
         - H left-aligned (3-tap), V centered (2-row sum): ``(l+2c+r)/8``
         - H and V centered: 2×2 box average
         - point-sample top-left luma sample only
       * - 4:2:2
         - H left-aligned (3-tap): ``(l+2c+r)/4``
         - H centered: box average ``(l+r)/2``
         - point-sample left luma sample only
       * - 4:1:1
         - **= "top_left"** (point-sample, left of the 4-column block)
         - box average over the 4-column block
         - point-sample, left of the 4-column block
       * - 4:4:0
         - **= "top_left"** (point-sample, top of the 2-row block)
         - box average over the 2-row block
         - point-sample, top of the 2-row block
       * - 4:1:0
         - **= "top_left"** (point-sample, top-left of the 4×4 block)
         - box average over the 4×4 block
         - point-sample, top-left of the 4×4 block

    The point-sample choices above match what tools with no signaled chroma siting
    do for these three ratios (e.g. ffmpeg's ``swscale``, which has no siting
    awareness at all for these pix_fmts and always resamples with a zero offset);
    the "=" rows above are why the per-format default (below) only ever
    needs to distinguish "mpeg1" from everything else, for all three of
    4:1:1/4:4:0/4:1:0 alike.

    For the **forced 4:4:4 round trip** case above, the same three names are also
    passed straight through as raw ``ChromaInPlacement``/``ChromaOutPlacement``
    strings to the underlying ``ConvertToYUV4xx`` calls — except that
    ``ConvertToYUV4xx``'s own parser does not accept all three names on every
    format, so Overlay translates where needed:

    .. list-table:: ``ConvertToYUV4xx`` ChromaIn/OutPlacement acceptance
       :header-rows: 1
       :widths: 10 30 30 30

       * - Format
         - ``"mpeg2"``
         - ``"mpeg1"``
         - ``"top_left"``
       * - 4:2:0 / 4:2:2 / 4:1:1 / 4:1:0
         - accepted as-is
         - accepted as-is
         - accepted as-is
       * - 4:4:0
         - rejected — Overlay sends ``"top"`` instead
         - accepted as-is (already means ``"center"``)
         - rejected — Overlay sends ``"top"`` instead

    When the internal working format is 4:4:4 already (RGB "blend"/"add"/"subtract",
    or any already-444 source) or Y (greyscale), this parameter has no effect: there
    is no subsampled chroma to site, on either the mask-downsampling or the
    forced-444-round-trip side.

    Default: not given explicitly, the value is resolved the same way
    ``ConvertToYUV4xx``'s own ``ChromaInPlacement`` resolves it (see
    ``chromaloc_parse_merge_with_props``): the base clip's ``_ChromaLocation`` frame
    property is used if present (mapped down to the nearest of the three buckets
    above — ``left``→``"mpeg2"``, ``center``→``"mpeg1"``, everything else→
    ``"top_left"``); otherwise a per-format hardcoded default is used: ``"mpeg2"``
    for 4:2:0/4:2:2/4:1:1, and ``"top_left"`` for 4:4:0/4:1:0 (which, per the point
    above, behaves as point-sample there — matching ffmpeg's untagged ``swscale``
    behavior for these formats).

    Note that ``placement`` is a single value for the whole filter call, applied
    uniformly to the base clip, the overlay clip, and the mask. For the
    conversionless/native-mode mask-downsampling case it is not verified against any
    of their actual, individual chroma siting, nor are they checked against each
    other — see the caveat under ``use444`` above.


RGB considerations
------------------

RGB inputs are accepted. However, Overlay for specific modes may convert the RGB clip
internally to 4:4:4 (see Avisynth+ exceptions), this will lead to an RGB→YUV conversion. 
There are two modes for this conversion, toggled by the ``pc_range`` parameter. This 
parameter will extend the YUV range from 16-235 (8 bit example) (this is the range 
used by all Avisynth converters) to 0-255. There are some cases where enabling 
``pc_range`` is a good idea:

* When overlaying an RGB clip using the ``add``, ``subtract`` or ``multiply`` modes,
  the range of the overlay clip is better, if it is full range (PC range), since this 
  will enable completely dark areas not to influence the result (instead of adding 16 
  to every value; since 16 is the "limited" range lowest nominal value).
* When NOT doing a colorspace conversion on output. If the output colorspace 
  (RGB vs. YUV) is different from the input, the scale will be wrong. If 
  ``pc_range=true``, and input is RGB, while output is YV16, the YV16 will have an 
  invalid range, and not CCIR-601 range.
* Planar RGB formats are also supported besides 8 bit packed RGB formats plus RGB48/RGB64.
* "blend", "add", and "subtract" modes keep original RGB format, no YUV intermediate 
  conversion is used for RGB input.

**Outputting RGB**

It might be a good idea to let Overlay output YV24 or YUV444P10-16, even if your 
input colorspace is RGB, as this avoids a colorspace conversion back to RGB from 
YUV. You should however be aware that your material might be "overscaled", as 
mentioned above, if you use ``pc_range=true``. You can correct this by using 
``ConvertBits(fulls=true, fulld=false)`` or ``ColorYUV(levels="pc->tv")`` to 
convert back to 16-235 range (or equivalent ranges to 10+ bits). 

**Inputting RGB for mask clip**

An RGB mask clip may behave a bit oddly if it contains color information. 
If you use a greyscale ``mask``, or if you leave ``greymask=true``, you will get 
the result you would expect. Note that mask values are never scaled, so it 
will automatically be in full-range, directly copied from the RGB values.
Traditionally, the mask is retrieved from channel "B" (Blue).
The maximum mask value is bit depth dependent, 255 for 8 bit, 65535 for 16 bit,
and 1.0 for 32-bit float formats.

**Using RGB32, RGB64 or planar RGBA alpha channel**

Overlay ignores the alpha (transparency) channel in an RGB32 clip. If you 
want the alpha, you can use something like 
``Overlay(kitten, mask=kitten.ExtractA())`` or
``Overlay(kitten, mask=kitten.ShowAlpha("RGB32"))``.

See also :doc:`Extract filters <extract>` and :doc:`ShowAlpha <showalpha>`.

**Repeated overlays on RGB base clip**

For modes, where RGB is not directly supported, when doing repeated partial 
overlays on an RGB base clip, the unchanged parts of the base clip may 
undergo a RGB→YV24→RGB conversion for each call to Overlay, producing a progressive 
loss of color accuracy. In these situations, it is better to convert the base 
clip to 4:4:4 format (e.g. YV24) before doing the overlays and convert back to 
RGB afterwards. Remember, that "blend", "add", and "subtract" do not convert from RGB.

Conditional Variables
---------------------

The global variables ``OL_opacity_offset``, ``OL_x_offset`` and
``OL_y_offset`` are read each frame, and applied. It is possible to modify
these variables using :doc:`FrameEvaluate <conditionalfilter>`. The values of these variables
will be added to the original on each frame. So if you specify "x = 100" as a
filter parameter, and the global variable ``OL_x_offset`` is set to 50, the
overlay will be placed at x = 150.

If you need to use conditional variables in multiple filters, use 
``condvarsuffix`` parameter to make them unique for each filter instance.

In other Overlay filters this can even be disabled by using the
``ignore_conditional = true`` parameter.

There is an example of conditional modification at the
:doc:`ConditionalReader <conditionalreader>` page.


Examples
--------

::

    # Prepares some sources.
    bg = ColorBars(512,384).ConvertToYUY2
    text = BlankClip(bg).Subtitle("Colorbars", size=92, 
    \          text_color=$ffffff).ColorYUV(levels="tv->pc")

    # Overlay the text in three different versions.
    return Overlay(bg, text, x=50, y=20, mode="subtract", opacity=0.25)
    return Overlay(text, x=50, y=120, mode="add", opacity=0.5)
    return Overlay(text, x=50, y=240, mode="blend", opacity=0.7)

    # Overlay yuy2 clip with rgb clip using a yuy2 mask
    # (note that the luma range of the mask is [0-255]). 
    return Overlay(yuy2clip, rgbclip, mask=rgbclip.ShowAlpha("yuy2"))

    # ...which is the same as 
    mask = rgbclip.ShowAlpha("rgb").ConvertToYUY2
    \             .ColorYUV(levels="TV->PC")
    return Overlay(yuy2clip, rgbclip, mask=mask)

    # ...which is the same as 
    mask = rgbclip.ShowAlpha("rgb")
    return Overlay(yuy2clip, rgbclip, mask=mask)

- This will take the average of two clips. It can be used for example to 
  combine two captures of different broadcast captures for reducing noise. 
  A discussion of this idea can be found [`here`_]. A sample script (of course
  you have to ensure that the frames of the two clips matches exactly, 
  using Trim as needed): 

::

    clip1 = AviSource("F:\shakira-underneath_your_clothes1.avi")
    clip2 = AviSource("F:\shakira-underneath_your_clothes2.avi")
    Overlay(clip1, clip2, mode="blend", opacity=0.5)

- Another use is to detect an altered video using Video Error Level Analysis 
  (VELA), where clip2 is clip1 resaved using an h.263 Codec (e.g. XVID). 
  This method is effective when the suspected altered video (clip1) has 
  not been resaved multiple times. Levels is used to exaggerate contrast 
  for view-ability:

::

    clip1 = AviSource("SuspectVideo.avi")
    clip2 = AviSource("SuspectVideo_resaved.avi")
    result= Overlay(clip1,clip2,mode="Subtract").Levels(0, 5.0, 100, 0, 255)

- Use a blue (or any other color) background (blue.jpg is a blue frame
  overlaid with subtitles in a black rectangle) as mask. The black rectangle
  containing the subtitles will be visible on the source clip (which is
  :doc:`ColorBars <colorbars>` here):

::

    testcard = ColorBars()

    # get a blue mask clip (the same blue as in ColorBars is used: R16 G16 B180)
    maskclip = BlankClip(testcard, color=$0f0fb4)

    # Example subtitle file with blue backgroud as above
    subs = ImageSource("F:\TestClips\blue.jpg").ConvertToRGB32

    maskclip = ColorKeyMask(subs, $0f0fb4, 60)

    Overlay(testcard, subs, mask=ShowAlpha(maskclip), mode="blend", opacity=1)

.. image:: pictures/overlay_blue.jpg
.. image:: pictures/overlay_subs.png


A tolerance of 60 is used here because the blue is not entirely uniform. Near
the black rectangles the blue is given by R23 G22 B124. Probably due to the
compression of blue.jpg.

- Move a red (or any other color) dot on a clip using ``ConditionalReader``
  (dot.bmp is a red dot on a black background):

::

    a1 = ColorBars().Trim(0,399)
    a2 = ImageSource("F:\TestClips\dot.bmp").ConvertToRGB32

    # a2.GreyScale returns a grey dot on a black background; Levels makes the dot white
    mask_clip = Mask(a2, a2.GreyScale.Levels(0, 1, 75, 0, 255))
    Overlay(a1, a2, mask=ShowAlpha(mask_clip), y=0, x=0, mode="blend", opacity=1)

    ConditionalReader("xoffset.txt", "ol_x_offset", false)
    ConditionalReader("yoffset.txt", "ol_y_offset", false)

Make xoffset.txt containing the x-positions and yoffset.txt containing the
y-positions of the moving dot (see :doc:`ConditionalReader <conditionalreader>` for more info), and
put it in the same folder as your script:

::

    xoffset.txt

    Type int
    Default -50

    R 0 100 20
    I 100 200 20 250
    R 200 300 250
    I 300 400 250 400 ::yoffset.txt

    Type int
    Default -50

    R 0 100 20
    I 100 200 20 350
    R 200 300 350
    I 300 400 350 40

.. image:: pictures/overlay_dot.png
.. image:: pictures/overlay_dot2.png

thus the dot moves in the following way: (20,20) -> (250,350) -> (400,40).
Nb, it's also possible to do this with Animate.

And the same with using ``condvarsuffix``:

::

    a1 = ColorBars().Trim(0,399)
    a2 = ImageSource("F:\TestClips\dot.bmp").ConvertToRGB32

    # a2.GreyScale returns a grey dot on a black background; Levels makes the dot white
    mask_clip = Mask(a2, a2.GreyScale.Levels(0, 1, 75, 0, 255))
    Overlay(a1, a2, mask=ShowAlpha(mask_clip), y=0, x=0, mode="blend", opacity=1, \
            condvarsuffix="_a")

    # directly read the _a prefixed variable
    ConditionalReader("xoffset.txt", "ol_x_offset_a", false)
    # or _a as exactly named parameter
    ConditionalReader("yoffset.txt", "ol_y_offset", false, condvarsuffix="a")


Test script for different bit depths with and without masks

::

    # Prepares some sources.
    bg = ColorBars(512,384).ConvertToYV16() # or ConvertToYUV444()
    text = BlankClip(bg).Subtitle("Colorbars", size=92, 
    \          text_color=$ffffff).ColorYUV(levels="tv->pc").ConvertToYV16()
    mask = BlankClip(bg).Subtitle("I am the Mask", size=62, 
    \          text_color=$ffffff).ColorYUV(levels="tv->pc")
    
    # use these two lines for RGB tests instead of YUV

| Changelog |                                                                        |
+===========+========================================================================+
| 3.7.6     | | "add" and "subtract" support 32-bit float input.                     |
|           | | "add" and "subtract" support RGB input without 4:4:4 conversion.     |
|           | | Check for unsupported 32-bit float, such modes give error.           |
|           | | Add ``placement`` parameter ("mpeg2" default, "mpeg1", or            |
|           |   "top_left").                                                         |
|           | | Relevant for conversionless mode (``use444=false``) with subsampled  |
|           |   YUV and greymask.                                                    |
|           | | Fix: masked "add"/"subtract"/"darken"/"lighten"/"difference"/        |
|           |   "exclusion"/"softlight"/"hardlight" now match the unmasked result    |
|           |   exactly at mask=0/max, restoring the guarantee already established   |
|           |   for "blend" (r2502).                                                 |
|           | | Blend engine rewritten to use exact integer "magic division" (see    |
|           |  MagicDiv) instead of internal float math for integer bit depths; float|
|           |  is now used only for the native 32-bit float pixel format path (see   |
|           |  3.7.2 below, now superseded).                                         |
|           | | Native (``use444=false``) processing extended to 4:1:1, 4:4:0 and    |
|           |   4:1:0 for "blend", "luma" and "chroma" (previously only              |
|           |   4:2:0/4:2:2/4:4:4/RGB).                                              |
|           | | ``placement`` now also applies to 4:1:1/4:4:0/4:1:0 (point-sample    |
|           |   "top_left"-style default, "mpeg1" for centered averaging).           |
|           | | ``placement`` default now also resolves from the base clip's         |
|           |   ``_ChromaLocation`` frame property (matching ``ConvertToYUV4xx``'s   |
|           |   own precedence) when not given explicitly; falls back to the per-    |
|           |   format default otherwise.                                            |
|           | | Base/overlay/mask clip pixel format matching for the forced 4:4:4    |
|           |   round trip (4:2:0, 4:2:2, 4:1:1, 4:4:0, 4:1:0) unified onto the real |
|           |   chroma-placement-aware resampler, replacing the old fixed-siting     |
|           |   internal 4:4:4 bridge previously used for 4:2:0/4:2:2 mismatches;    |
|           |   fixes a chroma shift on round-trip and keeps input/reconstructed     |
|           |   output siting consistent via ``placement``.                          |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3.7.2     | Address issue #255: "blend": now using accurate formula using float    |
|           | calculation internally. (Superseded in 3.7.6 by an exact integer "magic|
|           | division" approach, used for all integer bit depths; float is no longer|
|           | used internally except for the native 32-bit float format.)            |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3.7.1     | Overlay mode "multiply": overlay clip is not converted to 4:4:4        |
|           | when when 420 or 422, since only Y is used from it (speed).            |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3.7.0     || allow 4:1:1 input                                                     |
|           || fix crash when mask is YUV411 and greymask=false                      |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3.4.0     | Add "condvarsuffix" parameter                                          |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| r2502     | Correct masked blend: keep exact clip1 or clip2 pixel values           |
|           | for mask extremes 255 or 0.                                            |
|           | Previously 0 became 1 for zero mask, similarly 255 changed into        |
|           | 254 for full transparency (255) mask                                   |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| r2420     || "Blend" native greyscale mode: process y plane only w/o conversion    |
|           || automatic use444=false for "blend"/"luma"/"chroma"                    |
|           |  for inputs: 420/422/444 and any RGB, lossless Planar RGB intermediate |
|           |  for PackedRGB.                                                        |
|           || mask auto-follows input clip format. For compatibility: when          |
|           |  greymask=true (default) and mask is RGB then mask source is           |
|           |   the B channel 254 for full transparency (255) mask                   |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| r2359     || new parameter: bool use444 (default true for compatibility)           |
|           || lossless RGB "blend" w/o YUV conversion                               |
+-----------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| v2.54     | Initial Release                                                        |
